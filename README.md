# 321Contact_CS
// 321Contact is a c# program that reads stored contact information 
from a .dat file such as first name, last name, address, etc. and 
populates an array of type struct. It then uses that array to 
facilitate a search function based on first and/or last name. 
Furthermore, it allows one to output those search results to a file 
and to remove/delete Contacts from the array. Finally, it updates the 
original .dat file with any changes.
